# About me

Hello! I am Zehan yang, a Ph.D. in Statistics graduated from
[University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu).

My research interests are Survival Analysis, Optimal
Subsampling and Statistical Computing. I have been working on the
optimal subsampling method for big survival data based on parametric
and semi-parametric accelerated failure time model for three years.

Besides my own research, I was a research assistant in
[Department of Public Health Sciences](https://health.uconn.edu/public-health-sciences/)
in the [University of Connecticut, Health
Center](https://health.uconn.edu) from Septemper, 2021 to December, 2023. 
I have finished multiple consulting projects for medical researchers and medical doctors.
